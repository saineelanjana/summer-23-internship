# A glimpse into my 2023 summer of personal growth and skill-building as an AT&T TDP intern

As my enriching 10-week journey at AT&T as a Systems and DevOps Engineering Intern within their esteemed Technology Development Program concludes, I find myself reflecting on an incredible experience.

## Acknowledgments

I extend my heartfelt gratitude to the individuals who played a pivotal role in making this internship so remarkable:

- **Mart Hoover (Associate Director)**: Your warm welcome and unwavering support created an inclusive environment.
- **Himanshu Tiwari (Business Partner)**: Your mentorship was invaluable, connecting me with the right resources to enhance my skills and contribute to projects.
- **Atlantis Team**: Everyone on the team was so ready to help and answer my questions that I truly felt included and not lost.
- **Intern Innovation Challenge Team S.T.A.R.S**: I had a lot of fun brainstorming and working with you guys.

I would also like to express my appreciation to **Bernadette Gbondo** for streamlining the recruiting process and answering all my questions. And lastly, to my **fellow TDP interns** who became such good friends and made it a really fun summer.

## Project: Atlantis Feature Store Team

### Role and Responsibilities

Over the summer, I had the privilege of being a part of the Atlantis Feature Store team. My role involved:

- **Designing and Prototyping**: Creating high-fidelity prototypes in Figma for an activity and lineage page.
- **Front-End Development**: Learning the Angular framework and working with HTML and CSS to develop both pages.
- **API Integration**: Integrating APIs into the user interface for seamless functionality.
- **Deployment**: Successfully deploying the product onto the staging environment.

### Project Impact

My efforts culminated in the creation of an activity and lineage page that provides users of the feature store with a comprehensive view of feature set manipulation and historical information. This initiative promotes transparency, data management accountability, and user insights over time.

## Intern Innovation Challenge: Project S.T.A.R.S

As part of the Intern Innovation Challenge, my team conceptualized and developed "S.T.A.R.S" (Smart Triaging and Rescue System), a product leveraging AI to optimize emergency dispatch processes.

### My Role

In this endeavor, I played the role of co-scrum master, taking charge of scheduling meetings, designing prototypes in Figma, researching existing solutions, and keeping the team aligned with the timeline.

## Continuous Learning and Growth

During my internship, I actively pursued personal and professional growth:

- I undertook the task of studying for the Microsoft Azure Fundamentals certification, acquiring valuable insights into cloud computing.
- Immersed in the AT&T environment, I attended meetings, collaborated with colleagues, and developed a comprehensive understanding of the corporate landscape.

## Memorable Connections

Beyond the projects, what truly made this experience memorable were the connections I forged:

- **Fellow Interns**: I am grateful for the friendships I built with other interns, fostering an environment of camaraderie.
- **AT&T Employees**: Meeting and interacting with AT&T employees enriched my understanding of the company culture and values.

## Gratitude

As I conclude this chapter of my journey, I extend my gratitude to AT&T for offering me an opportunity to learn, contribute, and grow. My summer at AT&T has been an unforgettable and transformative experience, and I eagerly look forward to applying the skills and insights I've gained to my future endeavors.
